My first foray into coding

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing; few people do, so I feel ok about it.<P>
Lao Tzu once said something pofound about empty bowls. I am REALLY feeling that lesson right now.

There once was a fellow named Rick<P>
Who thought he was pretty damn slick<P>
he buggered around<P>
with each girl in his town<P>
and now Rick's dick is quite sick
