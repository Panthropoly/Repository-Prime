My first foray into coding

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing; few people do, so I feel ok about it.
Lao Tzu once said something pofound about empty bowls. I am REALLY feeling that lesson right now.

There once was a fellow named Rick
Who thought he was pretty damn slick
he buggered around
with each girl in his town
and now Rick's dick is quite sick
